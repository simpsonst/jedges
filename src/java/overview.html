  The input polygon is known to be made of several adjacent polygons,
  possibly in a regular pattern, e.g., a grid of squares, some of
  which form the compound polygon.  Knowing how all element polygons
  share edges, which edges follow on from other edges, and whether two
  edges are parallel, anti-parallel, or neither, a multisegmented path
  can be followed such that, when filled with an even-odd fill rule,
  the compound polygon is drawn.  This library computes efficient
  (though not necessarily optimum) paths from that data.

  <p>
    Multicoloured grids are also supported.  Each colour forms one or
    more polygons, each being traced separately, and overlayed.  This
    overlaying can be exploited to simplify paths on lower layers,
    where upper layers are expected to cover the unnecessary portions
    of the lower layers that achieve path simplicity.

  <p>
    Element polygons may take any form, but rectangular grids are
    directly supported.

    As a bonus, there is also some code for computing Voronoi cells.
    I might not keep them here.
